# Tweet Event Detection Proof of Concept done before the actual project at office
A small TensorFlow proof of concept for detection of customer life events from Twitter API data for a single node. 

# Steps
1. Extract the corpus files in the same directory as App.py.
2. Execute 'python App.py' in a terminal to see results.
3. Optionally run 'python Twitter.py' to extract corpus from Twitter API by modifying Twitter.py file.
  a) Plug in your own Twitter API account parameters in the file to connect.
  b) Change the word set to extract tweets corresponding to each category. They'll be written to files in the same directory.
